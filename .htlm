Exploratory Data Analysis
Project Description: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on DAP processing and summarizing bulk datasets required by the City of Vancouver
Project Title: AWS Data Analytic Platform for The City of Vancouver
Objective: The primary goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the 311 contact center metrics dataset to design and implement a data analytic platform to support descriptive analysis. By analyzing various features such as Date, Calls_Offered, Calls_Handled, Calls_Abandoned, Average_Speed_of_Answer, Service_Level, and BI_ID, we aim to understand the factors that influenced the likelihood of the service of 311.
Dataset: This dataset consists of 311 service information, including details such as:
	Date: 2024-1-1 to 2025-1-31
	Calls_Offered: the time of 311 offering calls (seconds)
	Calls_Handled: the time of 311 handling calls (seconds)
	Calls_Abandoned: the time of 311 abandoning calls (seconds)
	Average_Speed_of_Answer: the time of average speed of answers from 311 (seconds)
	Service_Level: 311 service level (0-1)
	BI_ID: The ID number of providing services
When uploading the dataset in AWS, the data profile overview (see Figure 1) can show the summary of this dataset.

Methodology:
1. Data Collection and Preparation and Cleaning:
	Download the dataset from the City of Vancouver
	Observing the initial dataset, which includes missing values, outliers, and data type.
	The initial data is mostly cleaning, so I just adjusted the two decimal places and then changed this dataset to a CSV file to be uploaded to AWS S3 Buckets (see figure 2 and figure 3)

2. Descriptive Statistics:
All data are numerical values, but Service_Level and Average_Speed_of_Answer are not integers. 
3. Data Cataloging:
I created a new bucket called 311-ctc-mtr-cur and sub-folders for metrics including system and user folders, which will be stored for summarization. When the Crawler was ready, the cleaning data was transferred to databases for 34 cataloging and prepared for summarization (See Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6).

	The highest website traffic is 2500 on 2023-2-29
	The correlation between website traffic and sales: 0.224236537 
4. Insights and Findings:
	The highest correlation of sales is the temperature, and the higher the temperature is, the higher the sales are.
	The highest sales happened in March, so marketing spending was also used most in this month.
5. Recommendations:
	The sales rely more on the temperature, so adjusting the suitable temperature in the store is essential, although the outside temperature cannot be controlled.
	The marketing expenditure can be reduced gradually, particularly in the month with higher sales.

Data Wrangling 
Project Description: The City of Vancouver needs to migrate to AWS, and we implemented a data analytic platform.
Project Title: AWS Data Analytic Platform for The City of Vancouver
Objective: The primary goal of this project is to perform comprehensive data wrangling to prepare a robust dataset for the 311 Contact Center at The City of Vancouver. By cleaning, transforming, and consolidating data from various sources at AWS, the project aims to enhance the accuracy and usability of this data for subsequent analysis and reporting.
Background: The City of Vancouver needs to migrate its data to AWS, and I selected one of the datasets about the 311 Contact Center. However, this data needs cleaning, otherwise making it challenging to derive meaningful insights. Effective data wrangling will facilitate better decision-making.
Dataset: The data wrangling process will involve one dataset, including:
	Date: 2024-1-1 to 2025-1-31
	Calls_Offered: the time of 311 offering calls (seconds)
	Calls_Handled: the time of 311 handling calls (seconds)
	Calls_Abandoned: the time of 311 abandoning calls (seconds)
	Average_Speed_of_Answer: the time of average speed of answers from 311 (seconds)
	Service_Level: 311 service level (0-1)
	BI_ID: The ID number of providing services
Methodology:
1. Data Collection:
	Download the dataset from the City of Vancouver
	Observing the initial dataset, which includes missing values, outliers, and data type.
2. Data Assessment and Cleaning:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/333c58bc-2e48-4dc8-bb76-e0e6bf1708f3)
 
I did the ruleset for data quality and then set the conditional router, including passed and failed, and then changed the schema before load, including dropping the useless columns. Finally, I loaded the Passed and Failed into the corresponding folders. 
3. Data Transformation and Consolidation:

After loading the passed and failed in Visual ETL, the corresponding datasets have already been published into each sub-bucket in the transfer bucket, which can be downloaded for different uses.
Tools and Technologies:
	AWS S3 and AWS Glue
Deliverables:
	A cleaned and transformed 311 Contact Center dataset ready for analysis, particularly for Passed Dataset in a CSV format.
	Confirmation of data quality checks conducted during the process.
Timeline:
	Expected completion of the project: Week 9 and Week 10, including phases for assessment, cleaning, transformation, and documentation.
This data wrangling project aims to establish a high-quality dataset that enables the City of Vancouver to conduct adequate 311 Contact Center Data.
